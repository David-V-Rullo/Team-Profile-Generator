# Team-Profile-Generator

## About

This is a small node.js app that uses the inquirer module to ask a series of questions to a potential manager. These questions revolve around a series of variables for each member of the team. The manager has the choice of adding engineers and interns. The answers provided are then turned into an HTML document that gives a concise visual representation of the new team. 

##Dependencies 

This app uses node's built in FileSystem(fs), Inquirer, and Path. 

They can all be installed using Node Package Manager(NPM).
